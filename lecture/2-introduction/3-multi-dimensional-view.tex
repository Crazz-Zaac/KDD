\begin{frame}{A Multidimensional View of Data Mining}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Data to be mined}:\\
		\small{Database data (extended relational, object oriented, 
		heterogeneous, legacy), data warehouse, transactional data, stream, 
		spatiotemporal, time-series, sequence, text and web, multi-media, 
		graphs.}
		\item \textbf{Knowledge to be mined (or data mining functions)}:\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Characterization, discrimination, association, 
			classification, clustering, outlier analysis, etc.
			\item Descriptive vs. predictive data mining.
			\item Multiple/integrated functions and mining at multiple levels.
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Techniques utilized}:\\
		\small{Database, data warehouse (OLAP), machine learning, statistics, 
		pattern recognition, visualization, high performance computing, etc.}
		\item \textbf{Applications adapted}:\\
		\small{Retail, telecommunication, banking, fraud analysis, bio data 
		mining, stock market analysis, text mining, web mining, etc.}
